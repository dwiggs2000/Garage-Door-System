Collaborated on the design and implementation of a cutting-edge dual-authentication garage door system using embedded system
development principles. Developed on a Raspberry Pi, the system integrates a keypad, camera, and servo motor. It requires users to input a
correct keycode, captures their image through the camera, sends it via SMTP email, and allows access through a webpage hosted on the
Raspberry Pi, which activates the servo motor to lift the garage door. Personally contributed to all aspects of the project, with a focus on building
the main program for keypad, camera, and email control.
